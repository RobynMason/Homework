    <h1 id="theHeader">The History of Cupcakes</h1>
    <p>The earliest description of a cupcake was in 1796, when a recipe was written in "American Cookery" by Amelia Simmons. The earliest description of the term cupcake itself was in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's cookbook. A standard cupcake uses the same basic ingredients as standard-sized cakes: butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. Nearly any recipe that is suitable for a layer cake can be used to bake cupcakes.</p>
